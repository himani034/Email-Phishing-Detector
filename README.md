Phishing Email Detector
This project is a Phishing Email Detection system that uses machine learning to classify emails as phishing or safe. It incorporates text preprocessing, encryption for secure handling of data, and a Flask-based web interface for user interaction.

Features:

Text Preprocessing: Cleans email content by removing URLs, HTML tags, punctuation, and stopwords.

Machine Learning Model: Trained using Multinomial Naive Bayes for email classification.

Encryption: Ensures secure handling of email data.

Web Interface: User-friendly web app built with Flask for testing email content.

How It Works

Preprocessing:

Input email content is cleaned using preprocess.py to remove unwanted elements and reduce noise.

Model Training:

model.py uses a dataset of labeled emails to train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model.

Features are extracted using TF-IDF vectorization.

Web Application:

app.py provides a Flask-based interface where users can input email content to classify it as phishing or safe.

Email content is encrypted before processing to ensure security.

Prediction:

The model predicts the label of the email and displays the result on the web interface.
Limitations

The modelâ€™s accuracy depends on the quality and size of the training dataset.

May misclassify sophisticated phishing emails or emails in languages other than English.

Requires further optimization to handle highly complex phishing patterns.

Future Enhancements

Use a larger, more diverse dataset for improved accuracy.

Implement advanced models like BERT for better classification.

Add support for multiple languages.

Provide detailed explanations for classification results.
